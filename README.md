Getting Started
---------------

**Note: back-end server must be started first.**

### `front-end folder`

Consists of the front-end UI.

### `back-end folder`

Consists of the back-end APIs.

### `Notes`

- Things that can be improved on ***front-end*** side
    1. Write better test cases, with better coverage.
    2. Show more details for block details transaction table (e.g. input and output tables).

- Things that can be improved on ***back-end*** side
    1. Implement pagination from backend.
    2. Can add database to retain data on backend instead of making continuous calls to fetch same data (assuming data doesnt update for past dates/time).
